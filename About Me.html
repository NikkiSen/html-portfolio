<h1>About Me</h1>
<p1>At the start of my professional Agile journey, I encountered a pivotal moment while working at a company deeply entrenched in Waterfall methodology but eager to transition to Agile. I seized the opportunity to attend a 5-day Agile boot camp, immersing myself in the teachings and absorbing every detail like a sponge. Upon my return, armed with newfound knowledge and enthusiasm, I spearheaded the Agile transformation within my teams. I have since successfully guided my teams at two Fortune 500 companies through the transition from Waterfall to Agile, a process that has been immensely fulfilling. By fostering strong cross-functional partnerships and team cohesion, I streamlined workflow processes, resulting in improved product quality and a 25% reduction in project timelines.</p1>
<p>
<p1>My passion for Agile goes beyond professional growth; it reflects a deeper personal calling. With a natural inclination towards nurturing and supporting others, I found my true purpose when I discovered the role of Scrum Master. This role, which emphasizes fostering growth, collaboration, and delivering quality results, resonated deeply with me. The concept of being a servant leader, dedicated to supporting and empowering others, became my guiding philosophy. I committed myself wholeheartedly to mastering this role, driven by a desire to excel in supporting my teams.</p1>
<p>
<p1>In my pursuit of excellence, I dedicate my free time to staying abreast of the latest developments in Agile. I engage with podcasts, immerse myself in books, and participate in Agile conventions and training sessions. These endeavors keep me current and provide me with a wealth of new ideas to enhance and improve my teams' performance.</p1>
